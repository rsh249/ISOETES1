##How to run ncbi2kraken.py
##This is a python script that executes an NCBI nucleotide database search and translates resulting sequences to kraken compatible fasta files for inclusion in custom databses.

./ncbi2kraken.py -e <email> -s <ncbi search string> -o <output directory>

#Test query strings here before running: 
#Email is required, speeds up queries by using search history.
#Output directory will be created if it does not exist.
